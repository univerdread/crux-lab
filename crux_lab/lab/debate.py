# Adapted from Crux (Univer's earlier project): backend/debate.py. Changes: asymmetric defender/attacker exchange (reply -> rejoinder -> close) instead of symmetric sides, structured concession detection replaces the convergence judge, turn events kept for SSE/replay.
"""The exchange engine. One exchange = Defender reply -> attacker rejoinder (no literature) ->
Defender close. Like Crux, turns run sequentially and every speaker sees the transcript so far;
unlike Crux, the exchange stops early when the defender concedes (detected from a structured
field, not by a judge)."""
