        Each objection faces two defenders separately and keeps the outcome most favourable to the paper, so a label
        here holds against both. Research directions are ranked by lead score: survival × novelty × the Assessor’s
        quality score out of 5. Labels describe the state of the
        debate, never whether the paper’s conclusion is true. Separately, an Assessor agent reads every direction
        like a journal referee and gives it a quality grade (promising, needs work, or not yet defensible) with the
        strongest objection to it and what the paper would need.

            automated clients. The lab does not work around bot protection, so it used OpenAlex, which indexes much of
            the same literature. A PhilPapers API key does not open it either: the key is
            accepted, but that address no longer serves OAI-PMH, and PhilPapers’ terms point to the philarchive.org
            address, forbid mass-querying by scripts, and ask third parties to get in touch for bulk access. Asking
            PhilPapers to allow this harvester is the way to bring PhilArchive back in.
